The International Tennis Federation stripped Serena Williams of all titles, trophies, and other acclaimed achievements Tuesday after a painstaking review of her career revealed she has been playing with a tennis racket in each hand since making her professional debut. “Upon analysis of thousands of photos and hundreds of hours of video of her 39 Major title matches, it’s clear Serena has employed two rackets since her professional debut at the ’95 Bell Challenge, granting her a substantial and patently unfair competitive advantage,” said ITF president David Haggerty, acknowledging that the speed and fluidity of Williams’ swings had long confounded tournament organizers, line judges, and opponents alike. “We initially launched an investigation into the matter in 2009 after receiving several anonymous complaints, but results were inconclusive; we now suspect that Serena was holding one racket behind her back during our otherwise intensive questioning.” In a related report, Tiger Woods has been stripped of his 14 major titles after officials discovered Woods has been playing golf with two clubs in each hand.


Regretting all the time and energy they wasted caring for the grass lawn, the grounds crew at the All England Club in Wimbledon was reportedly frustrated Monday after learning about the existence of cement tennis courts. “This is painstaking work in the hot sun, trimming and watering every single day. Why didn’t someone just tell us we could pour out cement, paint on some lines, and be done with it?” asked head groundskeeper Neil Stubley, noting that to maintain perfect consistency, they had to aerate and fertilize the grass with scientific accuracy, all of which takes millions of dollars and thousands of hours of labor every year. “We’ve been doing this for decades, just assuming this was the way you had to make a tennis court, and nobody once bothered to tell us about cement. Do you know how temperamental soil is? Not to mention it gets worn down after two days of play and looks like shit. Next year, Wimbledon is going cement.” At press time, Stubley had grown even more furious after learning about the existence of indoor stadiums.


Suddenly overcome by a swell of emotion while rebuking the other members for their unwillingness to share the burden of mutual security obligations, a tearful President Trump admitted Wednesday to his fellow world leaders that the NATO alliance is the closest thing to friendship he’s ever had. “I’m sorry to get so sentimental, but this is really the first time in my life that I’ve ever even come close to experiencing a real sense of camaraderie with other human beings,” said a sniffling Trump, his voice cracking while noting that he can’t remember a time prior to their yearly summits when he felt like he belonged and could be his true self. “I know that we argue and say some really horrible things to each other sometimes, but this relationship I have with all of you is so special to me. The bond that the 29 of us share is my dearest, most cherished possession, and I will treasure it always.” Trump then asked his allies to forgive his emotional display before reminding them that if they don’t put forward the full 4 percent of their GDP for defense, they can “all fucking forget about receiving any U.S. military support in the future.”

Shocked that the personal correspondence would take such a cold and impersonal tone, delinquent tenant Ross Grimley, 28, found the eviction notice posted on the door of his apartment to be disturbingly all business. “I thought they would at least give me a ‘good morning’ before getting down to brass tacks, but ‘to whom it may concern’ makes it sound like I may not even care about getting kicked out of my own place,” said Grimley, noting that the form letter rudely tacked over his peephole did not even refer to him until the third sentence, and even then only obliquely as “tenant.” “In situations like this, I feel like a little bit of warmth would go a long way, but instead it’s all stilted decorum, ‘pursuant to a written lease’ this and ‘occupancy will be forfeited’ that. I mean, after living here for over a year, you’d think I’d have earned a little human recognition.” Grimley also expressed surprise that his landlord hadn’t learned some manners after the previous two “rather rude” eviction notices were also ignored.

Arguing that there was no conceivable reason they should be anywhere else, local woman Nora Jay confirmed Wednesday that the good scissors weren’t in the fucking drawer where they belonged. “God damn it, where the hell are they? I don’t know how I’m supposed to finish wrapping this birthday present without my one decent pair of scissors,” said Jay, 30, as she tore through her home in search of the Fiskars premier craft scissors she’d paid over $15 for at Michael’s. “I don’t know what asshole moved them from the one fucking place they’re supposed to be, but now I guess I’m going to be forced to make do with the kitchen shears or those shitty little blue ones I got from IKEA. Jesus Christ, these things can barely cut!” At press time, Jay told reporters that she had located the scissors in the other drawer.

Insisting that the controversial episode served as a stirring reminder of the importance of self-improvement, Netflix representative Tina Komal spoke in defense of a recent episode of ‘Queer Eye’ wherein the the Fab Five were forced to euthanize a contestant who was a completely hopeless slob. “We certainly wish that this contestant had been capable of enacting the simple tips suggested by our team of lifestyle experts, but unfortunately, euthanization was ultimately deemed the only practical option for improving his life,” said Komal in a stirring defense of the episode where, after futilely encouraging the unemployed Tim Yonkers to try on a variety of tailored button-up shirts and walking him through a fresh mango salsa recipe to shake up his carb-heavy diet, the Fab Five solemnly led Yonkers out to his re-landscaped backyard to be mercy-killed with a single gunshot to the head by grooming guru Jonathan Van Ness. “Though the episode may be upsetting to some of our viewers, we must also remember the countless viewers who have been deeply touched by Yonkers’ story and the team’s tireless efforts to help him—which happened to include a little tough love.” Komal went on to add that, at the conclusion of the episode, Yonkers’s friends and family had been delighted by the changes he’d undergone.

Acknowledging that the former president’s enthusiasm for the project made it all the harder to come clean, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos was reportedly unsure Friday how to tell Barack Obama his series idea was just Fawlty Towers. “Oh God, he clearly put so much work into the pitch, but I don’t know how to tell him that John Cleese and Connie Booth already did the exact same thing, like, 40 years ago,” said Sarandos, attempting to find a tactful way to inform the former chief executive that his idea for Chez Obama, which would star the 44th president as a temperamental hotel proprietor who gets into all manner of farcical situations as he tries to corral his eccentric guests and wacky employees, was basically identical to the beloved British sitcom. “I’m just sitting there nodding along as he goes on and on about how there would be so many opportunities for physical comedy in an episode where a bellhop’s pet rat escapes the same day as the health inspector arrives, and I freeze. What am I supposed to say? He’s honestly never heard of this show before? Then he gets all excited talking about how Michelle could even play the intelligent, put-upon chambermaid, and my heart just about broke.” After receiving the bad news, an undaunted Obama immediately launched into his backup pitch for a 12-part miniseries about the early Roman Empire as told from the perspective of the elderly emperor Claudius.

Feigning polite interest throughout the 90-minute meeting, Pentagon officials from all five branches of the armed forces listened in silence Thursday as Mike Pence presented his detailed plans for a state-of-the-art angel-guided weapons system. “Though we are grateful for the vice president’s interest in national defense, the prospect of using seraphim-targeted bombs and heretic-seeking missiles to protect America from hostile sinners is not feasible, nor indeed useful, at this time,” said Secretary of Defense James Mattis, graciously thanking Pence for his hand-drawn schematics of a proposed Holy Ghost cloaking device that would allow planes to fly undetected above the homes of prostitutes and thieves. “Obviously, we cannot plan our defense against North Korea around the face of God appearing before Kim Jong-un and turning him into a pillar of salt, but it’s not like I can tell the vice president of the United States to stop talking. Luckily, he wound down after explaining how the Gabriel’s Trumpet Alert System worked, which is just as well, because apparently the idea behind it is that we would just all ascend bodily into Heaven, which in many ways contradicts our current strategic goals.” The National Guard, however, may consider Pence’s contingency plans for non-lethal counters to possible civil unrest, saying the idea of a crowd-dispersing holy water cannon is “not completely without merit.”

Despite the years of effort and success in lower-level religious practice, a group of professional scouts told reporters Friday that they strongly doubt Tim Tebow will ever make it to heaven. “I know he’s put in a lot of prayers and missionary work, but when it comes to getting to heaven, Tebow just doesn’t have the raw spirituality you need,” said scout Gregory Veitch, adding that Tebow’s lifelong commitment to finding eternal bliss in the divine Kingdom of God was impressive, but that it takes a really special kind of talent to make it all the way to the top. “I could see him spending some time in purgatory for sure—there are always open spots for someone as devoted to Christ as Tebow—but he needs to accept reality and realize that getting to heaven is just something that isn’t going to happen.” At press time, Tebow had decided to abandon Christianity and try his hand at reaching heaven through Judaism.

Touting the release as an unmatched innovation in green technology, Elon Musk held a press event Wednesday to unveil Tesla’s new clean energy automobile, a sleek midsize luxury sedan pulled by eight Tesla employees. “I’m excited to stand before you today and announce the &8, Tesla’s latest great advance in our ongoing journey towards completely environmentally responsible transportation—this new vehicle, with its multi-redundant, human-focused propulsion system, is even more efficient than electric models, and I’m proud to say it was born and bred right here in America using a 100 percent renewable, 99 percent biodegradable power source with forest-friendly emissions,” said Musk, who demonstrated the machine’s octuply-redundant voice-activated navitainment system, which, like the powertrain, fully supports tethering, adaptable all-surface cartilaginous shock absorbers, and “torture mode” overdrive, in which seven subsidiary drive units are slaved directly to a controlling “master motivator.” Tesla also claims that the new continuously variable transmission runs in complete silence, though press drivers noted some light huffing, puffing, and occasional moaning during highway tests. “The &8 will completely change the way Americans view clean energy vehicles. As usual, the purchase price will include the ability to easily recharge the power plant at any Applebee’s, but this is an extremely hardy, fuel-efficient—in many ways, self-sufficient—and ecologically aware vehicle. Customers can even visit the Tesla headquarters to select the exact parts that work best for them, from optional vegetable-fueled drive units to self-healing, scratch-resistant bodies in their choice of colors.” Musk also teased the upcoming announcement of a new HyperLoop high-speed rail locomotive using a much larger version of the &8’s core system.

Expressing immense gratitude for their role in normalizing and promoting the pursuits of marginalized people, the National Alliance on Mental Illness issued a statement Thursday praising the National Rifle Association for decreasing the stigma around mentally ill people acquiring firearms. “There are still many Americans who hold prejudices against people with schizophrenia purchasing assault weapons, but the NRA has made incredible strides to help reduce that bias,” said NAMI representative Rebeccah Vance, lauding the NRA’s tireless efforts to advocate for all potentially unstable Americans to easily purchase a firearm, no matter their age, background, or history of mental illness. “It’s often hard for someone who’s suffering from symptoms of mental illness to be able to do a simple thing like buying a firearm; however, now those suffering from psychiatric disorders are no longer forced to live in the shadows. Thanks to the NRA, all Americans can easily satisfy their violent urges without enduring humiliating, unnecessary background checks.” At press time, the NRA received glowing praise for their fearless efforts to help secure firearms for all those convicted of domestic violence.

Shedding new light on the vulnerability of low-income Americans struggling in the face of a Mack truck, a report from the Brookings Institution confirmed Thursday that the poor are often hit hardest by 18-wheelers. “The economically disadvantaged face a great variety of challenges, but sometimes the single factor having the greatest impact on individuals earning less than $20,000 per year is a semi failing to stop and plowing into them as they attempt to cross the street,” said Brookings senior research fellow Tim Brownridge, adding that members of households living at or below the poverty line are typically unprepared to survive the full force of a tractor trailer barreling down the highway at 75 miles per hour. “Without exception, every person in this income bracket has a hard time recovering from a direct hit by a 40-ton big rig. The severe mark left on a financially struggling family of four by a fast-moving Peterbilt or Freightliner simply cannot be overstated.” The report follows a parallel study published last week that found the top 1 percent of American earners are often hit hardest by their own helicopter’s rotor blades.

Resigning herself to the fact that perhaps she just wasn’t meant to have smooth, detangled hair, area woman Candace Fard confided to reporters Thursday that after being let down by yet another leave-in conditioner, she wasn’t sure she could ever put herself out there again. “I’ve been burned so many times before, and I don’t want to waste any more of my life, you know?” said Fard, who sighed while gazing longingly at a Pantene magazine ad boasting all-day frizz protection before angrily ripping the page to pieces at the memory of her own half-used bottle, which she decided to part with after discovering it made her bangs greasy. “It’s so hard to see all my friends finding the perfect leave-in conditioner for them while I sit here trying product after product and nothing ever works out. Like, I’m happy for them, but why can’t I have what they have? Sometimes, it feels like there’s not even anything out there for my hair type. Maybe it’s time I give up and just accept myself as a woman with dry, tangled hair.” At press time, Fard was reportedly fielding a call from her mother, whose friend Joan had insisted she had a conditioner that would be a perfect match.

Man Wishes There Was Some Sort Of Sign He Could Put On His House To Let Visitors Know He Has Gone Fishing.

Emphasizing how important it was for his well-being to cut the cord and start harassing more minorities in person, white supremacist Alan Kearney, 63, told reporters Thursday that he’s been living a much more fulfilling, racist life since getting kicked offline. “Sitting behind a screen all day was really taking its toll on me, which is why it’s been so refreshing to actually find ‘Unite The Right’ rallies or Klan meetups where I can interact face-to-face with other extremists like myself,” said Kearney, whose recent ban from Reddit and 4chan was just the push he needed to leave the house and find a community of like-minded people who believe their racial superiority must lead to the formation of a pure ethno-state by any means necessary. “Sure, there were Jews and Muslims I was telling to kill themselves online, but it’s much more rewarding to go out into the real world, stand outside a synagogue or mosque, and do it there. It’s so much more liberating.” Kearney added that, most importantly, his decision to be racist in the real world sets a good example for his racist children.

Given pause after witnessing the consequences of their actions, members of a sixth-grade class at River View Middle School reported feeling kind of bad Wednesday after discovering how little effort it took to make their teacher, 23-year-old Kayla Martin, cry. “Oh, jeez, now I feel guilty—I realize we were being a little bit mean to her, but I had no idea she was just gonna burst into tears like that,” said student Daniel Rivera, 11, adding that he and his classmates “weren’t even laying it on all that thick” when the first-year teacher turned off all the lights, yelled at them to put their heads down on their desks, and retreated to the back of the room, where she could be heard quietly weeping. “Sure, a few of us were deliberately talking over her every time she tried to speak. And Madison and her friends kept pointing and making fun of Ms. Martin’s shoes. But she lost it in, like, half the time it used to take Mrs. Bergman to start crying. The poor young thing.” At press time, the sixth-graders confirmed feeling absolutely terrible after Ms. Martin had wordlessly pressed play on an educational film about fossils and returned to sit at her desk in the dark.
